## Description
Flow created to facilitate adding backup data to the **Task List**. When there is a problem with the Task List, for example tasks deleted by mistake, the user can search the **Backup** folder for a backup file, and then use this Flow to automatically recover the missing data in the **Task List**.

## Trigger Action

* **taskList_ColumnValue**: **Object** type variable used to store the column/field and its values ​​of an item present in the Backup file, and this information is used in the "**Create item** - Task List" action.
