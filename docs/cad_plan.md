## IFC Block Export

IFC block export is designed to streamline export of GIS information into CAD blocks with attributes. Integrating with UI this gives user the flexibility of handling multiple layers such as Poles, Splice, MPT's, Civic and Underground features. This functionality also ensures the CRS are transformed uniformly and using memory layers without affecting the original data. It also has an error handling capabilities to identify what layer and attributes causing error.
