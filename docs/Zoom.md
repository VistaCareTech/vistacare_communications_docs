# Zoom to Feature

The "Zoom to Feature" functionality streamlines spatial data exploration by providing an intuitive way to zoom into, highlight, and revisit specific map features. The integration of zoom history management, visual flashing of features, and table interaction makes this development user-friendly and highly interactive, facilitating efficient navigation and analysis within a GIS system.

## Key Features
1. Zooming to Specific Features: The user can select specific features (e.g., id, name) by layer, field, and feature value through a series of combo boxes. Based on these selections, the map canvas zooms into the specified features, centering and scaling the view appropriately.

2. Flashing Selected Features: After zooming, the selected features are flashed on the map, alternating between blue and gray colors, providing visual feedback to the user. This helps in quickly identifying the features of interest on the map.

3. Zoom History Management: A history of the last 5 zoom operations is maintained in a table widget. The table records the selected layers, fields, and feature values, allowing users to revisit recently zoomed features. Users can check specific rows for re-zooming or remove entries from the history.

4. Table Interaction for Zoom and Flash: The zoom table allows users to select rows corresponding to previously zoomed features. By checking these rows, users can zoom in on those features again and re-flash them on the map for better interaction.

5. Clear and Reset Options: Users can clear individual zoom entries or reset the entire zoom table to start fresh. This ensures flexibility in managing the zoom history and keeping the interface clutter-free.
